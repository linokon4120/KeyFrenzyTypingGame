## Project Information
In this project, we created an arcade game application called KeyFrenzy, with the main objective of helping the user increase typing speed, responsiveness and accuracy in the English language as they proceed within the game. 

The main task of the player is to defend the main objective (main character) from being attacked by another objective (the ghost). To do so, the player must input a string of characters that is of the English language that matches the one prompted on top of the attacking objective, and if the string is inputted before the attacking objective reaches the defended objective, the attacker shall be eliminated. The movement of the attackers is characterised by the x-y axis with the defended objective located at the intersection of both axes. The player would be given a set of chances called “lives” to attempt to defend the main character from being attacked. The specifics of the game is to be determined as it is being developed and tested, including final graphics, character appearances and behaviour, and player-related numerical technicalities.

The game would have multiple levels, with every level going up the complexity of the provided strings and the number of strings would increase accordingly, and the input time for the player would be decreased accordingly. Customisation would be provided for the main character in the form of naming. Background maps would be altered within every level to increase in-game dynamics. If all the levels are passed, the player will win. If the player lost in only one of the levels, they would have to restart the entire game. The level would be discrete, and the changes would be displayed instantaneously as the user progresses to the next level.

may not quite know all the details yet.*

* ● A couple of paragraphs summarizing what this project is.


* ● Explanation of your package structure
* ● List all third-party libraries you used that are not part of the standard Java API (yes, you should include JavaFX here). Include version numbers of all libraries and URLs to the library's main page. ● Please provide a URL to your video presentation (your URL should point to a video placed on Google Drive or Bucknell's media space. See details on presentation).
