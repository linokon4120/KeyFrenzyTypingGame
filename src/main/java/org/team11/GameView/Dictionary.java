 * Package: org.team11.GameView
 * Class: Dictionary
 *
 * Description: this class reads the dictionary and puts it in a map with the
 * key = length of the words and the value are all the words of that length
 * this class supports a getword method.
 * the getword method returns a List<String> based on
 * the level of the game and the number of words desired in the List<String>
 * this method is also overidden so that the number of words in the List<String>
 * is always 16 and the level increments each time the method is called
